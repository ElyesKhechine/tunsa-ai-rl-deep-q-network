**Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Keras-RL, OpenAI Gym, Numpy, CartPole-v0, DQN, Boltzmann Policy, Dopamine-RL

## Introduction

This project, undertaken by TUNSA AI, focuses on leveraging advanced reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the stability of a pole balanced on a moving cart within the CartPole-v0 environment.

## Project Scope

Executed from October 9, 2022, to November 13, 2022, this project aimed to develop a robust reinforcement learning model capable of efficiently stabilizing the cart pole system. Led by a dedicated team, the project involved rigorous experimentation and optimization of deep Q-learning algorithms.

## Technical Details

- **Reinforcement Learning Model**: Developed a robust TensorFlow and Keras-based reinforcement learning model capable of stabilizing the cart pole system within the CartPole-v0 environment.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Designed a neural network architecture comprising three layers, fine-tuning 770 parameters to effectively classify 4D input states, resulting in a 14% faster training convergence.
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN) Agent**: Implemented a DQN agent using Keras-RL and a Boltzmann policy, training it for 50,000 steps and achieving an average episode reward of 42.6 over 100 test episodes.
- **Model Refinement**: Iteratively refined model parameters and hyperparameters, leading to a 19% reduction in mean absolute error and achieving a 93% success rate in stability over five test episodes.
